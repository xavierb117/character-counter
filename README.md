# character-counter

An exercise to test using JUnit. Please fork and clone the repository and open it up in VS Code. You will be given further instructions in class. A few reminders:

1. Make sure to copy the clone URL from your fork. It should have your username in it.
1. Use the `git clone` command. Do NOT download it as a zip!
1. When opening in VS Code, make sure you open the character-counter directory, not any directory above it. If you did it properly, the left hand file explorer in VS Code should have CHARACTER-COUNTER directly under EXPLORER with no other directories in between.
